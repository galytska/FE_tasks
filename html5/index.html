            Being outside is about more than just barbecues and beaches. The latest scientific research has proven that
            spending time in the fresh air surrounded by nature’s beauty boosts the body and the brain in more than one
            way.

            Besides the positive impact on the planet, spending time outdoors has been proven to have an uplifting
            effect on the wellbeing of its residents. As the Head of the Social and Economic Research Group of Forest
            Research, Dr Liz O’Brien has been researching how forests and trees can improve the health and wellness of
            people. According to Dr O’Brien’s findings, <em>the diversity of the scenery and wildlife in forests
            enhances a sense of freedom and stimulates the senses.</em> This improves how they feel about themselves,
            others and
            the world. Other benefits of getting up close and personal with Mother Nature include:

                According to science the color green gives a psychological energy boost. Because of all the green around
                outside, spending 20 minutes in open air gives an energy boost more or less like having a cup of coffee.
                This means it is also easier to exercise outside.

                A study found that patients recovering from surgery who are exposed to intense sunlight tend to use less
                pain medication.

                Scientists believe that breathing in phytoncides (<i>chemicals produced by plants</i>) may increase
                white blood cells which help us fight off infections. This means that spending time outside may boost
                our immune systems.

                Psychologists have discovered that backpackers scored a higher percentage on creativity tests after
                spending time in the wild. So, for those who struggle with writer’s or artist’s block, the outdoors may
                help.
